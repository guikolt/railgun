## Introduction
WireSockUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to simplify the setup and management of the WireSock VPN Client. It provides a convenient way to configure tunnels, manage connections, and monitor status without the need to interact with command-line tools directly.

## Features
- **Easy Setup**: Quickly configure WireSock VPN tunnels and settings.
- **Connection Management**: Enable or disable tunnels with a single click.
- **Logging & Status**: View real-time connection logs and current status information.
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Designed to be lightweight and efficient.

## Getting Started
1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases](https://github.com/wiresock/WireSockUI/releases) page.
2. **Install & Run**: Follow the installation prompts. Once installed, run the application to access the WireSockUI dashboard.
3. **Configure**: Provide your VPN server details, credentials, and any custom settings. Save your configuration, then start or stop tunnels as needed.

## Transition to WireSock Secure Connect
Since WireSockUI is no longer maintained, we recommend moving to [WireSock Secure Connect], which offers:
- A modern, user-friendly interface.
- Continued development and support.
- All existing WireSockUI features, plus additional enhancements and improvements.
